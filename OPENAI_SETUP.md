# OpenAI Integration Setup Guide

## âœ… What's Been Fixed

### 1. File Upload UI Issue
- **Problem**: File upload button was always visible, making it seem like file upload was required
- **Solution**: Moved the paperclip button to the right side of the input field, so users can type freely without being prompted to upload files
- **Result**: Users can now chat normally, and only upload files when they click the paperclip button

### 2. OpenAI API Integration
- **Problem**: App was only using demo responses
- **Solution**: Integrated real OpenAI API with GPT-4 model
- **Result**: App now uses real AI responses when API key is configured, falls back to demo mode when not configured

## ðŸš€ How to Set Up OpenAI Integration

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy your API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in your project root with:

```env
# OpenAI API Configuration
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1

# Optional: Enable debug mode
REACT_APP_DEBUG=true
```

**Important**: Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your real API key!

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

### Without API Key (Demo Mode)
- App automatically falls back to demo responses
- Shows realistic financial analysis based on your message content
- Perfect for development and testing

### With API Key (Real AI)
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for real AI responses
- Maintains conversation history
- Analyzes uploaded files and provides context
- Generates relevant attachments based on AI responses

## ðŸ’¡ Features

### Smart File Handling
- Upload files by clicking the paperclip button
- AI receives context about uploaded files
- Generates summary attachments for uploaded files
- Supports PDF, CSV, Markdown, HTML, Text, and JSON files

### Intelligent Responses
- AI understands financial context
- Provides relevant templates and frameworks
- Creates helpful attachments (budget templates, investment frameworks, etc.)
- Maintains conversation flow

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to demo mode if API fails
- Clear error messages in console
- No app crashes if API is unavailable

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_URL`: OpenAI API endpoint (default: https://api.openai.com/v1)
- `REACT_APP_DEBUG`: Enable debug logging (true/false)

### AI Model Settings
- **Model**: GPT-4 (can be changed in `src/services/api.ts`)
- **Max Tokens**: 2000 (adjustable)
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (adjustable for creativity vs consistency)

## ðŸš¨ Security Notes

1. **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control
2. **Keep your API key secure** - don't share it publicly
3. **Monitor your OpenAI usage** to avoid unexpected charges
4. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test Without API Key
1. Don't set `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY` or set it to `your-openai-api-key-here`
2. Send messages - should get demo responses
3. Check console for "No OpenAI API key configured, using demo mode"

### Test With API Key
1. Set your real API key in `.env`
2. Send messages - should get real AI responses
3. Upload files and ask questions about them
4. Check console for API calls and responses
