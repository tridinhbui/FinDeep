# üîê Google OAuth Setup Guide for FinDeep

This guide will help you set up Google OAuth authentication for your FinDeep application.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Console account
- FinDeep application running locally

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
3. Enter project name: `FinDeep OAuth`
4. Click "Create"

### 2. Enable Google+ API

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
2. Search for "Google+ API" or "Google Identity"
3. Click on "Google Identity" and enable it

### 3. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Choose "Web application"
4. Add authorized origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
6. Click "Create"
7. Copy the **Client ID** (you'll need this)

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

#### Frontend (.env)
```bash
# Add this to your .env file
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here
```

#### Backend (backend/.env)
```bash
# Add this to your backend/.env file
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here
```

### 5. Test the Integration

1. Start your backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node persistent-server.js
   ```

2. Start your frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
4. Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign up with Google"
5. Complete the Google OAuth flow

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Google services not loaded"
- Make sure the Google script is loaded in `public/index.html`
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is set correctly

#### 2. "Invalid client ID"
- Verify the Client ID in your `.env` files
- Make sure the Client ID is for a "Web application" type
- Check that the domain is authorized in Google Cloud Console

#### 3. "Redirect URI mismatch"
- Add your exact domain to authorized redirect URIs
- Include both `http://localhost:3000` and `https://yourdomain.com`
- Don't include trailing slashes

#### 4. "Access blocked"
- Check that Google+ API is enabled
- Verify OAuth consent screen is configured
- Make sure the app is not in testing mode (unless you add test users)
